# VirtualShop
This is virtual shop plugin for minecraft bukkit and spigot servers.  When I did this project, I was an amateur in Java. So there could be glitches. About educationial side of this project I have to say I use almost everything in Java but there is so many bad code practicing cases. I don't recommend you to take examples from this project. Bad documented, bad readibility, non reusable project lol.
<br>Java Subjects I use:
- Classes/Objects
- Class Methods
- Constructors
- Modifiers (public, private, protected, final, abstract, static)
- Encapsulation
- Making API
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Inner Classes
- Abstraction, Interfaces and Enums
- Date (in license system)
- Arraylist (Vector), Hashmap (Dictionary)
- Exceptions
- ...

I hope the codes are useful to you.
