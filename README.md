# VirtualShop
This is virtual shop plugin for minecraft bukkit and spigot servers.  When I did this project, I was an amateur in Java. So there could be glitches. About educationial side of this project I have to say I use almost everything in Java but there is so many bad code practicing cases. I don't recommend you to take examples from this project. Bad documented, bad readibility, non reusable project lol
